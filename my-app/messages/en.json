        "background_p1": "Eight years ago, our founder’s grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. In search of natural ways to support brain health, he discovered Lion’s Mane, a mushroom which gains recognition for its neuro-supportive properties. What began as a personal mission soon evolved into a passionate commitment to grow fresh Lion’s Mane with care and consistency.",
        "background_p2": "However, cultivating Lion’s Mane was not easy. It took years of trials and refinement to achieve reliable consistency. After his grandmother’s passing, the mission grew stronger: to deliver fresher, higher-quality Lion’s Mane to the local market.",
        "background_p3": "He discovered that most Lion’s Mane in the market came as dried imports. Yet their key bioactives, hericenones and erinacines, are extremely sensitive to drying and high heat. In other words, heavy processing would reduce the mushroom's potency.",
        "lab_title": "From Laboratory to Reality",
        "lab_p1": "Founded in 2019, MR FUNGUS (Remora Resources PLT) began as a dedicated R&D initiative to cultivate truly premium Lion’s Mane. After five years of relentless testing and refinement, we developed a stable and efficient growing system, making large-scale local production of high-quality Lion’s Mane a reality.",
        "lab_p2": "Starting from growing mycelium in petri dishes and transferring it onto 99% sterilized wood substrates, our method closely mimics the mushroom’s natural wild environment. By utilising European oak as the primary substrate, combined with advanced Japanese indoor-farming technology, we have achieved a truly organic, pesticide and contamination-free cultivation process."
